WeatherBuddy
Introduction
WeatherBuddy is an application that reports current weather and also gives a 5-day forecast for US cities. It gets its information from OpenWeather API. Current weather is at the top of the page, and the forecast is beneath that. Eight of the past searches will be recorded on the left side as buttons. This is an assignment from the UT Austin coding boot camp.
